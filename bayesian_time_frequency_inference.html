							  This is a website accompanying the thesis entitled <b>Bayesian approaches to time-frequency inverse problems</b>. Since this work is concerned with the restoration and analysis of degraded audio signals, many of the results presented in the dissertation are best appreciated through direct auditory assessment. For this reason, this website presents an audible version of the reconstructions obtained with the techniques proposed in this thesis. Supplementary material for chapters 3 to 6 is provided in <a href="#research">Supplementary material</a>.

							<p>Although the phenomenon of sound is intrinsically linked to the propagation of acoustic waves through physical
							media such as gas, liquid or solid, audio signals are better defined and understood by the way their spectral
							composition evolves over time. Characterising the dynamics of these hidden spectral components—rather
							than their raw waveform—is crucial for a wide range of practical applications involving sound. However, the
							mathematical description of auditory phenomena possesses a high degree of ambiguity due to the countless
							ways a signal can be broken down. Thus, employing prior knowledge and a probabilistic modelling approach
							that can account for uncertainty becomes essential.</p>
							<p>This dissertation studies the characterisation of audio signals as time-frequency dictionary representations
							and their application to audio reconstruction problems. To address the inherent ambiguity of overcomplete
							dictionaries, the assumed generative mechanism of the audio waveform is enriched with prior structures that
							not only serve as a regularisation device but also reflect domain-specific modelling assumptions based on the
							empirical observation of audio spectra. The resulting models are thus addressed through the well-established
							apparatus of Bayesian computation, which can be tailored to the specific problems investigated in this
							dissertation and leveraged in the formulation of efficient and high-quality audio signal restoration techniques.</p>
							
							<p>A synthesis-based approach is favoured throughout this dissertation. This means that, although some prior
							assumptions stem from the characterisation of spectral components, regularisation schemes are imposed on the
							regression coefficients of the dictionary representation (termed synthesis coefficients in the context of audio
							signal processing) instead of the short-time Fourier transform of a corrupted input signal (analysis coefficients).
							Hence the restoration techniques presented in this thesis are underpinned by generative models of the raw
							audio waveform itself rather than its spectrogram. This approach allows for great modelling flexibility and
							can organically handle data corruption mechanisms occurring in the waveform domain such as missing data
							entries, clipping or quantisation of the amplitude values, and stationary and non-stationary observation noise.</p>
							
							<p>The modelling assumptions adopted throughout this dissertation are varied. Chapters 2 to 4 explore a
							structured sparsity approach based on a hierarchical Bayesian variable selection scheme. This is accomplished
							through a spike-and-slab prior on the synthesis coefficients, which explicitly models the activation or exclusion
							of the basis functions of the time-frequency dictionary. Chapter 2 introduces a time-frequency dictionary based
							on the complex modified discrete cosine transform (CMDCT ) and derives a series of efficient Markov chain
							Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the synthesis coefficients. Building upon the dictionary and sampling
							techniques introduced in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 recasts time-frequency dictionary representations as state-space
							models and formulates a sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy to carry out real-time audio signal
							restoration. Exploiting a Gaussian mixture spike-and-slab prior, Chapter 4 develops a high-performance
							expectation–maximisation algorithm for sparse reconstruction of corrupted audio signals.</p>
							
							<p>Chapters 5 and 6 mark a departure from the sparse approximation paradigm, investigating instead the
							potential of low-rank latent structures in time-frequency inverse problems. Following a synthesis-oriented
							approach, the waveform production mechanism adopted in chapters 5 and 6 still relies on the expansion of
							a time-frequency dictionary, but regression coefficients are instead governed by a latent low-rank variance
							structure. The resulting mechanism is termed low-rank time-frequency synthesis (LRTFS) model and is tested
							on a series of audio reconstruction problems. Chapter 5 proposes a computationally feasible expectation–
							maximisation scheme to compute the latent parameters of the LRTFS model and examines its application
							in denoising, artifact removal and missing data interpolation tasks. In turn, Chapter 6 focuses on the
							reconstruction of clipped audio signals, for which an alternate minimisation strategy is presented.</p>
